## Developing YASGUI


Feel free to fork and develop this tool. If you have anything to contribute, submit a pull request.
To develop this tool locally, I'd advice to use the following procedure:

* Make sure npm and gulp are installed
* Run `npm install` from the gulp dir
* Run 'gulp serve' for debugging (disables some HTML5 manifest caching among others), or simply 'gulp' to run in production
